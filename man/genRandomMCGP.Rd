\title{Generate a bi-criteria graph with two uniformly randomly distribted edge weights.}
\usage{
genRandomMCGP(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Instance size, i.e., number of nodes.}
}
\value{
[\code{\link[grapherator]{grapherator}}] Graph.
}
\description{
The instance is composed of two
symmetric weight matrices. The first weight is drawn independently at
random from a \eqn{\mathcal{R}[10, 100]} distribution, the second one
from a \eqn{\mathcal{R}[10, 50]} distribution (see references).
}
\note{
This is a simple wrapper around the much more flexible graph generation
system in package \pkg{grapherator}.

\examples{
g = genRandomMCGP(10L)
